HTTP Digest Authentication is a more secure method than Basic Authentication for validating user credentials in the HTTP protocol. It uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that credentials are not sent in plain text over the network.

How HTTP Digest Authentication Works:

Client Request: The client requests a protected resource from the server without providing any authentication information.

GET /protected/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

Server Response: The server responds with a 401 Unauthorized status code and a WWW-Authenticate header that includes the authentication type (Digest) and a nonce value (a unique string that the server generates to prevent replay attacks).

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="example.com", qop="auth", nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093", opaque="5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40e41"

Client Response: The client resends the request, this time including an Authorization header with the Digest credentials. This header includes a hash of the username, password, nonce, HTTP method, and the requested URI, ensuring that the password is never sent in plain text.

GET /protected/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Digest username="admin", realm="example.com", nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093", uri="/protected/resource", response="6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1", qop=auth, nc=00000001, cnonce="0a4f113b"

Server Validation: The server validates the request by recalculating the hash using the nonce, clientâ€™s credentials, and request details. If the hash matches, the server grants access to the resource.

Security Features:
Nonce: A unique string generated by the server for each authentication attempt to prevent replay attacks.
Realm: A description of the protected area, which helps the client determine the appropriate credentials to use.
Quality of Protection (qop): Indicates the authentication mechanism used, such as "auth" for authentication.
Opaque: A string of data generated by the server that should be returned by the client unchanged.
Client Nonce (cnonce): A unique string generated by the client to ensure the request is unique.
Nonce Count (nc): Keeps track of the number of requests sent with the same nonce value, preventing reuse of the same request.

Example:
Here's an example of how Digest Authentication might look in practice:

Initial Request (unauthenticated):

GET /protected/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

Server Response:

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="example.com", qop="auth", nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093", opaque="5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40e41"

Client Request (with Digest Authentication):

GET /protected/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Digest username="admin", realm="example.com", nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093", uri="/protected/resource", response="6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1", qop=auth, nc=00000001, cnonce="0a4f113b"

Server Response (if authenticated successfully):

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
