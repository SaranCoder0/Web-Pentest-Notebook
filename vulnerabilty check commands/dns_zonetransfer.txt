What is Zone Transfer?
Zone Transfer (AXFR): A type of DNS transaction where the primary DNS server provides a complete copy of the zone file to a secondary DNS server.
Purpose: Used for redundancy and load balancing in DNS infrastructure.

How Zone Transfer Works
Initiation: The secondary DNS server requests a zone transfer from the primary DNS server.
Transfer: If allowed, the primary server sends the entire zone file to the secondary server.

Vulnerability Details
Unauthorized Access: If the DNS server is not properly configured, unauthorized users can request and receive the zone file.
Information Disclosure: Exposes sensitive information such as internal hostnames, IP addresses, and other DNS records.
Potential Impact: Attackers can use this information to map the network, identify targets, and plan further attacks.

Detecting Zone Transfer Vulnerability

Example: Testing with dnsrecon
dnsrecon -d <target-domain> -t axfr

Example: Testing with dig 
dig axfr @dns-server target-domain

Note: To identify basic DNS scan 
dnscan -d xxx.com
