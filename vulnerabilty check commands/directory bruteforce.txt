Directory brute forcing is a technique used in web pentesting to discover hidden directories and files on a web server. This process involves using wordlists to systematically try different directory and file names against a target website. Successful identification of hidden directories and files can reveal sensitive information or expose potential vulnerabilities.
Tools for Directory Brute Forcing

    DirBuster
        A GUI-based Java application designed to brute force directories and files on web servers.

    Dirsearch
        A fast command-line tool written in Python that performs brute force scanning for directories and files.

    Gobuster
        A fast command-line tool written in Go that can perform directory/file brute forcing and DNS subdomain brute forcing.

    FFuF (Fuzz Faster U Fool)
        A fast web fuzzer written in Go that can be used for directory and file brute forcing as well as other types of fuzzing.

Common Wordlists

    SecLists
        A comprehensive collection of wordlists for security testing, including directories and files.

    Dirbuster-Lists
        Wordlists specifically designed for directory and file brute forcing.

Example Commands

Here are some example commands for using the above tools:

DirBuster:
java -jar DirBuster.jar -u http://example.com -l /path/to/wordlist.txt

Dirsearch:
dirsearch -u http://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt

Gobuster:
gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt

FFuF:
ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt

Custom Wordlists

Creating custom wordlists tailored to the specific target can increase the success rate of discovering hidden directories and files. Hereâ€™s how you can generate a custom wordlist:

    Analyze the Website Structure:
        Look at common patterns in the URLs and directory structures.

    Use Web Archives:
        Check the Wayback Machine or similar services for historical versions of the website.

    Leverage Existing Resources:
        Combine common wordlists with terms specific to the target domain (e.g., products, services, technical terms).
