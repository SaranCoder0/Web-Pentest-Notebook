Subdomain enumeration is a crucial step in the reconnaissance phase of web pentesting and bug bounty hunting. It involves discovering subdomains associated with a target domain to uncover additional attack surfaces. Here's a brief overview of some common tools and techniques used for subdomain enumeration:
Tools for Subdomain Enumeration

    Sublist3r
        A Python tool designed to enumerate subdomains using search engines.

    Amass
        An advanced tool that uses a variety of methods to gather subdomains, including scraping, DNS lookups, web archives, and more.

    Subfinder
        A fast subdomain enumeration tool written in Go, which is designed for use with automation.

    Assetfinder
        Another fast tool written in Go that focuses on finding subdomains.

    Aquatone
        A tool for visual inspection of websites across subdomains and domain names.

    Knockpy
        A Python tool that relies on dictionary-based attacks for subdomain enumeration.

Techniques for Subdomain Enumeration

    Search Engine Discovery
        Utilizing search engines like Google, Bing, and others to find indexed subdomains.

    Certificate Transparency Logs
        Analyzing public logs of SSL/TLS certificates to discover subdomains.

    DNS Brute Forcing
        Using wordlists to brute force possible subdomains.

    Passive DNS Data
        Leveraging historical DNS data from services like DNSDumpster, VirusTotal, and others.

    Web Archives
        Using the Wayback Machine and other web archives to find old and potentially forgotten subdomains.
