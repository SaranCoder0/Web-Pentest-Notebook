The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) regularly updates its list of the top ten most critical security risks to web applications. As of the latest update (2021), the OWASP Top Ten are:

1.Broken Access Control

Improperly enforced permissions can allow unauthorized actions and access to sensitive data.

2.Cryptographic Failures

Weak or improperly implemented cryptographic functions can expose sensitive data.

3.Injection

Improper handling of user input can lead to various types of injections, like SQL, NoSQL, or LDAP, that can compromise data integrity and confidentiality.

4.Insecure Design

Flaws in the design phase that fail to consider security threats can lead to vulnerabilities in the application.

5.Security Misconfiguration

Incorrectly configured settings or default configurations that aren't properly secured can be exploited by attackers.

6.Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Using components with known vulnerabilities or failing to update them can be exploited to compromise the application.

7.Identification and Authentication Failures

Weak authentication mechanisms or improper session handling can allow unauthorized access.

8.Software and Data Integrity Failures

Failures in maintaining the integrity of software and data, such as relying on insecure CI/CD pipelines, can lead to unauthorized code execution or data manipulation.

9.Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Inadequate logging and monitoring can prevent timely detection of and response to security breaches.

10.Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

When an application fetches remote resources without validating the user-supplied URL, it can lead to attacks on internal services.

These categories highlight areas where web applications are most at risk and provide a framework for prioritizing security improvements. For detailed descriptions and recommendations, you can visit the official OWASP Top Ten website.
